# hello-world
Setting up GitHub.
The purpose of this branch is to get started with using github to save different things I'm learning. Saving it on a computer was a pain when I wanted to take a look at the code and continue working on it on a different computer.

Different technologies this repo will contain involve projects in Java, Spring, C#, ASP.NET, ReactJS, the MEAN stack, Python, and other technologies I feel I should include.
